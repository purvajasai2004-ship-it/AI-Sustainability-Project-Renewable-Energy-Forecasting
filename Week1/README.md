# 🌍 AI-Based Renewable Energy Forecasting & Optimization System

## 📘 Overview
This project uses Artificial Intelligence (AI) to predict renewable energy generation (solar or wind) using weather and environmental data.  
It helps optimize energy storage and usage to promote sustainability and support **UN Sustainable Development Goal 7 — Affordable and Clean Energy**.

## ⚙️ Problem Statement
Renewable energy generation is clean but highly unpredictable because of changing weather conditions.  
This unpredictability causes instability in energy supply and storage management.  
The project aims to solve this using AI forecasting and optimization models.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Predict renewable energy generation using AI models (LSTM, Prophet, etc.)
- Analyze how weather factors (temperature, humidity, irradiance) affect energy production
- Optimize energy storage and distribution based on forecasts
- Build an interactive dashboard for visualization

## 📊 Dataset
- **Source:** [Global Data on Sustainable Energy (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/anshtanwar/global-data-on-sustainable-energy)
- **Features include:**
  - Date
